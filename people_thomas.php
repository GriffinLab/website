    <b>Biography</b><br />
    I am a postgraduate student in the EPSRC funded 4-year Security Science Doctoral Training Centre. I was originally a physicist but have converted to computer science, although I do like to dabble in physics from time to time.
    I have previously worked on radar image processing at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, and on analysis of data from the LHCb experiement (CERN) at Technische Universität Dortmund. 
    <br />Within the Griffin lab, I am currently working on a project funded by Rapiscan Systems Ltd. on the automated analysis of transmission X-ray cargo images.
    My main interest is in applying physics and mathematics to real life security problems.<br /><br />
